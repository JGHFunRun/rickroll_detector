# rickroll_detector
A python program to detect rickrolls with just the youtube link.

Usage: clone this repo or download zip

run the main.py file with python (no external requirements needed)
Input the youtube link you want to check
It will print "True" if the video is a rickroll, and "false" if its not.

This program can even detect rickrolls in disguise because it not just checks the link but the content too

Good luck and never get rickrolled again :D
