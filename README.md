# rickroll\_detector
A python program to detect rickrolls with just the youtube link.

Usage: clone this repo or download zip

run the main.py file with [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (no external requirements needed)
Input the youtube link you want to check
It will print "True" if the video is a rickroll, and "false" if its not.

This program detects rickrolls in disguise too, pretty consistently, because it not just checks the link but the content too (such as comments, etc.).
It also works with shortened urls leading to a youtube video.

Good luck and never get rickrolled again :D
